            <p>
                A refreshing blend of cantaloupe-infused mezcal, Campari, and vermouth.
                Served over ice with a citrus twist or cantaloupe garnish, it's the perfect summer sipper.

            <h4>New Wave Negroni</h4>
            <p>
                The New Wave Negroni is a refreshing and slightly bittersweet variation of the classic Negroni,
                with Aperol adding a touch of citrus and the Lillet Blanc providing a smooth, floral note.
                It's a perfect choice for those looking to try a modern twist on a timeless cocktail.

        <p>We envisioned a place where people can become people,
            a sanctuary of self-discovery and relaxation,
            where the rhythmic tides of the beach mirror the ebb and flow of our lives.
            Here, the sun-kissed sands become a canvas for your stories, and the salty breeze carries away your
            worries.
            Our vision is a haven where laughter and friendship intertwine with the gentle lull of the waves,
            creating moments as timeless as the ocean's horizon.
            Come join us at Lagoona Bar Miami and let the beach's embrace inspire your journey to
            self-discovery </p>
